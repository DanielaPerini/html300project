These Charts are the easiest to display the data I had.
The Area chart is great to visualize the rise of numbers and it shows the numbers precisely but it makes it a little hard to see which was the lowest and which was the highest year in electricity consumption.
The Column chart makes it easy to visualize how the production of renewale energy changed during the years, and you can easily see that the year of 1996 was the highest one and 1961 the lowest, thanks to the separated bars, but the numbers showed are not precise.
The Line chart is, in my opinion, the best of the three. It shows the numbers precisely and it is easy to see which year was the highest and which was the lowest. And it makes it easy to compare all the data I had.
